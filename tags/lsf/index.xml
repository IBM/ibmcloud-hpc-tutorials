LSF is an advanced workload management solution for demanding HPC environments. HPC cluster deployment starts with the definition of the desired cluster configuration; for example, count of management nodes, worker nodes, amount of storage and so on. Open-source technologies like Terraform and Ansible have been used to automate the provisioning and configuration of all associated IBM Cloud VPC resources and LSF.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Bursting</title><link>/03-bursting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/03-bursting/</guid><description>IBM Cloud offers virtual private clouds (VPCs), which enable elastic provisioning of x86 virtual servers with the pay-as-you-go model. Users can optimize both the cost and performance of their target workloads by maintaining the number of virtual servers and their resource configurations. VPCs support various instance flavors of virtual machines with from 1 to 128 virtual CPUs, from 4GB to 1TB RAM, and various capacity and performance settings of storage and networking.</description></item><item><title>Custom Image</title><link>/04-custom-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:49:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>/04-custom-image/</guid><description>In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to create a custom image that allows you to install custom software packages and later reuse the image for creating new LSF clusters. We assume you have followed the steps in &amp;lt;02-setup-lsf-cluster&amp;gt; to create an existing LSF cluster, and we will reuse its VPC infrastructure to create a VSI within it.</description></item><item><title>Prepare SSH and API Keys</title><link>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/01-sshkey-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:01:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/01-sshkey-api/</guid><description>Create Your SSH KEY After you sign in to https://cloud.ibm.com/ with your account, start with the Navigation Menu on the dashboard in the top left corner of the page:
Click VPC Infrastructure &amp;gt; SSH Keys
Click Create
Add name (e.g. demo-ssh-key), type your resource group name and select region Copy the public key and paste it in the public_key field(e.g.: contents in .ssh/id_rsa.pub) Click on Add SSH Key If you do not have SSH keys on your machine where you plan to log in to your HPC cluster, use the ssh-keygen command to generate.</description></item><item><title>Create Your Cluster using IBM Spectrum LSF</title><link>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/02-hpc-cluster-catalog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:05:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/02-hpc-cluster-catalog/</guid><description>After you sign in to https://cloud.ibm.com/ with your account, search &amp;ldquo;HPC&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Spectrum LSF&amp;rdquo; in IBM Cloud catalog. Find &amp;ldquo;IBM Spectrum LSF&amp;rdquo; and select the service. It will lead you to the HPC Cluster solution page. Or the tile can be directly accessed from here.
Scroll down to the Configure your workspace section. The resource group parameter in this section is where the Schematics workspace is provisioned on your IBM Cloud account.</description></item><item><title>Access Your Cluster</title><link>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/03-access-cluster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:03:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/03-access-cluster/</guid><description>Overview of the HPC Cluster The HPC Cluster consists of a login node, a storage node where the block storage volume is being attached to, 1 to 3 LSF management nodes, and a number of LSF worker nodes.
The login node is served as a jump host and it is the only node which has the public IP address. Other nodes would only have private IP addresses and the only way to reach to these nodes is through the login node.</description></item><item><title>Run LSF Jobs Using Auto-Scaling</title><link>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/04-run-job/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:03:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>/02-setup-lsf-cluster/04-run-job/</guid><description>worker_node_max_count and _worker_node_min_count are the parameters for you to configure auto-scaling. If you leave worker_node_max_count and _worker_node_min_count parameters with default values, you currently would have no worker node in your cluster.
In the example below, icgen2host-10-242-64-37 is the only node in your LSF cluser and is served as the LSF management node which is configured not to run users&amp;rsquo; workloads.

You can use Resources in the menu on the left to visualize all the resources created for your HPC cluster. The cluster configuration parameters will be listed when you click Settings. When you are ready to destroy your cluster, you can use Actions &amp;gt; Destroy resources to destroy your cluster. If you no longer want to keep the workspace, you can select Delete workspace instead.</description></item></channel></rss>
