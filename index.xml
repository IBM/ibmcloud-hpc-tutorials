Users can configure and start their cluster creation with Schematics, a Terraform platform with Web UI on IBM Cloud. The template is publicly available at GitHub for IBM Cloud. All you need to create a cloud HPC cluster is to set the GitHub link to a Schematics workspace, edit pre-defined variables, and click several buttons. This tutorial gives a step-by-step guide to creating an example VPN deployment.</description></item><item><title>Customize Software on the VSI</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/02-customize-software-on-the-vsi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:55:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/02-customize-software-on-the-vsi/</guid><description>From your local machine, login to the newly created VSI by running the following command (Note: After the VSI is in running state, you might still need to wait a few minutes before you can connect to it via ssh).
ssh -J root@&amp;lt;jump-node-ip&amp;gt; root@&amp;lt;new-instance-ip&amp;gt; You should find the jump-node-ip from the ssh login command generated while creating the existing LSF cluster.
Now customize the software on the VSI boot volume.</description></item><item><title>Set up multi-cluster and job forwarding</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/03-bursting/02-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 01:00:00 -0100</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/03-bursting/02-setup/</guid><description>Set up the LSF multi-cluster and job forwarding. This tutorial assumes that the small on-premise cluster labeled with &amp;ldquo;OnPremiseCluster&amp;rdquo; uses a subnet 192.168.3.0/24. The cluster runs a master node at 192.168.3.21 (on-premise-master) and two single-CPU workers (i.e., up to two CPUs are available for jobs). The cloud cluster labeled with &amp;ldquo;HPCCluster&amp;rdquo; uses a subnet 10.248.0.32/27 and its master uses 10.248.0.37 (icgen2host-10-248-0-37) without any static workers created. Both of the configuration directories are in /opt/ibm/lsf/conf, but you can change the directory depending on your cluster configuration.</description></item><item><title>Create Image From Customized Volume</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/03-create-image-from-customized-volume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:57:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/03-create-image-from-customized-volume/</guid><description>Now, we go back to the Cloud Shell for creating the new custom image.
Stop the VSI ibmcloud is instance-stop ${CUSTOM_IMG_VSI_NAME} Submit the request to create the custom image # Store Volume ID in a environment variable SOURCE_VOLUME_ID=$(ibmcloud is instance ${CUSTOM_IMG_VSI_NAME} --output JSON | jq -r .volume_attachments[0].volume.id) # Submit request to create image from the volume ibmcloud is image-create ${CUSTOM_IMG_NAME} --source-volume ${SOURCE_VOLUME_ID} This step can take some time depending on the image size.</description></item><item><title>Try cloud bursting</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/03-bursting/03-tryout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 01:00:00 -0100</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/03-bursting/03-tryout/</guid><description>Now you can forward jobs from on-premises to the cloud. This tutorial tries to request three CPUs by starting three concurrent sleep 10s although the example on-premise cluster has only two CPUs. At your on-premises cluster, you can test the following command:
$ for i in `seq 1 3`; do bsub -q send_q sleep 10s; done The cloud cluster needs a few minutes to allocate a dynamic host. After a while, you can check if cloud bursting works at on-premise-master.</description></item><item><title>Create Cluster From Custom Image</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/04-create-cluster-from-custom-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:58:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/04-custom-image/04-create-cluster-from-custom-image/</guid><description>The last step is to use the newly created image to create a new LSF cluster. We are working on adding the description for how to do so and we will add it very soon.</description></item><item><title>Prepare SSH and API Keys</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/01-sshkey-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:01:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/01-sshkey-api/</guid><description>Create Your SSH KEY After you sign in to https://cloud.ibm.com/ with your account, start with the Navigation Menu on the dashboard in the top left corner of the page:

Find &amp;ldquo;IBM Spectrum LSF&amp;rdquo; and select the service. It will lead you to the HPC Cluster solution page. Or the tile can be directly accessed from here.
Scroll down to the Configure your workspace section. The resource group parameter in this section is where the Schematics workspace is provisioned on your IBM Cloud account.</description></item><item><title>Access Your Cluster</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/03-access-cluster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:03:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/03-access-cluster/</guid><description>Overview of the HPC Cluster The HPC Cluster consists of a login node, a storage node where the block storage volume is being attached to, 1 to 3 LSF management nodes, and a number of LSF worker nodes.
The login node is served as a jump host and it is the only node which has the public IP address. Other nodes would only have private IP addresses and the only way to reach to these nodes is through the login node.</description></item><item><title>Run LSF Jobs Using Auto-Scaling</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/04-run-job/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:03:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/04-run-job/</guid><description>worker_node_max_count and _worker_node_min_count are the parameters for you to configure auto-scaling. If you leave worker_node_max_count and _worker_node_min_count parameters with default values, you currently would have no worker node in your cluster.
In the example below, icgen2host-10-242-64-37 is the only node in your LSF cluser and is served as the LSF management node which is configured not to run users&amp;rsquo; workloads.
[lsfadmin@icgen2host-10-242-64-37 ~]$ bhosts -w HOST_NAME STATUS JL/U MAX NJOBS RUN SSUSP USUSP RSV icgen2host-10-242-64-37 closed_Full - 0 0 0 0 0 0 In addition, since the worker_node_max_count parameter is set to 10, you can only submit jobs that use no more than 10 nodes.</description></item><item><title>Manage your Cluster</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/05-manage-cluster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:03:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/02-setup-lsf-cluster/05-manage-cluster/</guid><description>You can manage your VPC resources in the Schematics workspace. You can use Resources in the menu on the left to visualize all the resources created for your HPC cluster. The cluster configuration parameters will be listed when you click Settings. When you are ready to destroy your cluster, you can use Actions &amp;gt; Destroy resources to destroy your cluster. If you no longer want to keep the workspace, you can select Delete workspace instead.</description></item><item><title>Conferences Workshops</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/conferences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/conferences/</guid><description>List of workshops given at confernces Name Description reInvent 2021 AWS ParallelClusterAPI Introduction to the AWS ParallelCluster API and the PCluster Manager web UI to manage clusters Supercomputing 2021 Tutorial Collection of labs created for the full-day tutorial delivered by the AWS HPC team at SC21 Supercomputing 2020 Tutorial Find the labs created for the full-day tutorial delivered by the AWS HPC team at SC20 Supercomputing 2019 Tutorial Collection of labs created for the first full-day tutorial delivered by the AWS HPC team at SC19</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/authors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/authors/</guid><description> I-hsin Chung Ming Hung Chen Constantinos Evangelinos Lixiang Luo Dale Pearson Seetharami Seelam Robert Walkup Hui-fang Wen Chih Chieh Yang</description></item><item><title>External Workshops</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/external/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/ibmcloud-hpc-tutorials/external/</guid><description>List of External workshops Name Description Advanced Slurm on ParallelCluster This workshop shows advanced techniques with Slurm on ParallelCluster, including federation, accounting, and using the Slurm REST API with Jupyter notebooks Setting up a client library for the Slurm REST API A Jupyter notebook walkthrough of building and using a Python client library for the Slurm REST API</description></item></channel></rss>
