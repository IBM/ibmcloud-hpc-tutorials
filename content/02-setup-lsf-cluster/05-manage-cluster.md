You can manage your VPC resources in the Schematics workspace.
![autoscaling](/images/setup-lsf-cluster/hpc_destroy.png)

You can use **_Resources_** in the menu on the left to visualize all the resources created for your HPC cluster.
The cluster configuration parameters will be listed when you click **_Settings_**.
When you are ready to destroy your cluster, you can use **_Actions_** > **_Destroy resources_** to destroy your cluster.
If you no longer want to keep the workspace, you can select **_Delete workspace_** instead. It has options to allow you
to both destroy your cluster as well as your workspace.
