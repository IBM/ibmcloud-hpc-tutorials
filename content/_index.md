# Welcome to HPCA "HPC on IBM Cloud" Tutorials

### UPDATE 4/3/2022: you can still secure your IBM Cloud account during HPCA

HPC on IBM Cloud tutorial includes comprehensive access to IBM Cloud for all
participants during and shortly after the event until __4/15/2022__.  Application
will remain open during HPCA (__4/2 ~ 4/6__). Please follow these steps to apply
for your account:
 
1. **(You will) signup for a new IBMid ONLY (note the email address you use), WITHOUT creating an IBM Cloud account. Link:**
 https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776

2. **(You will) send us an email including the email address you used for your "new IBMid"**:  
- Email recipient: LIXIANG.LUO@ibm.com  
- Email title: [HPCA] Request for a hands-on account  
- Email content: the email address you used for your "new IBMid"

3. **(We will) invite your “new IBMid” to the hands-on account.**

4. **(You will) locate the invitation email sent from IBM Cloud and go through the sign-up process.**

5. **(You will) sign in IBM Cloud (cloud.ibm.com) using the “new IBMid”.**  
If everything goes as expected, you should see **"2533666 – LIXIANG LUO’s Account"**
on the top navigation bar.

Beyond the HPCA event, this website will evolve into an open-source
documentation project for "HPC on IBM Cloud" topics.  We aim to provide
tailored, step-by-step tutorials on various tasks in utilizing public cloud
resources for HPC workloads.  We hope to smooth the learning curve for the
transition from traditional on-premise HPC clusters to cloud-based or even
cloud-native workflows. Most information here are derived from references and
tutorials from IBM Cloud's online articles.

Topics on this website:

- **Cloud Basics** introduces the building blocks of cloud computing and
  basic preparations for going through the other topics.

- **Standing up an LSF Cluster** shows how to set up a HPC cluster on IBM
  Cloud, including how to use the autoscaling capability.

- **Cloud Bursting** explores the exciting possiblities of leveraging
  LSF-managed multi-cluster on hybrid cloud.

- **Custom Image** explains how to create your own custom VSI images hosted
  on IBM Cloud.

- **(Upcoming) HPC File Systems** discusses the options for a high-performance parallel
  file system on IBM Cloud.

- **(Upcoming) Performance tuning** provides cloud-specific performance
  tuning suggestions for HPC applications.
