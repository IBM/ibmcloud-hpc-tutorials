# Welcome to HPC on IBM Cloud Tutorials

This website is a growing open-source documentation project for "HPC on IBM
Cloud" topics.  We aim to provide tailored, step-by-step tutorials on various
tasks in utilizing public cloud resources for HPC workloads.  We hope to smooth
the learning curve for the transition from traditional on-prem HPC clusters to
cloud-based or even cloud-native workflows.  Most information here are derived
from references and tutorials from IBM Cloud's online articles. 



Current topics:

- **Cloud Basics** introduces the building blocks of cloud computing and
  basic preparations for going through the other topics.

- **Standing up an LSF Cluster** shows how to set up a HPC cluster on IBM
  Cloud, including how to use the autoscaling capability.

- **Hybrid Cloud Computing** explores the exciting possiblities of leveraging
  hybrid cloud for HPC

- **HPC File Systems** discusses the options for a high-performance parallel
  file system
