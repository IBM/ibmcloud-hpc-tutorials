In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to create a custom image that allows you to install custom software packages and later reuse the image for creating new LSF clusters. We assume you have followed the steps in [II - Standing up an LSF Cluster]({{< ref "/content/02-setup-lsf-cluster/01-sshkey-api.md" >}}) to create an existing LSF cluster, and we will reuse its VPC infrastructure to create a VSI within it.
